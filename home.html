            NASA and Boeing now are targeting March 29 for the launch of Starliner’s second 
            uncrewed flight test to the International Space Station as part of the agency’s 
            Commercial Crew Program. Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2) is a critical developmental 
            milestone on the company’s path toward flying crew missions for NASA.
            <br><br>
            For the OFT-2 mission, the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will launch on a United 
            Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral 
            Air Force Station in Florida, dock to the International Space Station and return 
            to land in the western United States about a week later as part of an end-to-end 
            test to prove the system is ready to fly crew.

            NASA and Boeing have completed Starliner’s last parachute balloon drop test ending 
            a reliability campaign that will help strengthen the spacecraft’s landing system 
            ahead of crewed flights to and from the International Space Station.
            <br>
            The campaign, developed by both Boeing and NASA, used six balloon drop tests of a 
            Starliner test article to gather supplemental performance data on the spacecraft’s 
            parachutes and landing system. Each drop test focused on a different set of adverse 
            conditions and used pre-flown parachutes to evaluate reusability margins for future missions.
            <br><br>
            Starliner is the first American-made orbital crew capsule to land on land. The 
            spacecraft uses a series of parachutes and airbags that deploy at specific altitudes 
            allowing Starliner to touch down gently in the desert of the western United States. 
            NASA also will use the data gathered from the parachute testing to model Starliner 
            parachute performance in different mission scenarios.

                The Expedition 64 crew expanded to seven members overnight after four Commercial 
                Crew astronauts docked the SpaceX Crew Dragon to the International Space Station.
                Now two cosmonauts are gearing up for a spacewalk set to start Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. EST.
                <br><br>
                The newest station crew members are asleep today following a 27-hour-and-half trip 
                from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center to the Harmony module’s forward-facing port. 
                Commander Michael Hopkins and Pilot Victor Glover, alongside Mission Specialists 
                Shannon Walker and Soichi Noguchi, docked on Monday at 11:01 p.m. The hatches were 
                opened two hours later, and the quartet entered the station to begin a six-month research mission.
                <br><br>
                All seven crewmembers gathered in the Harmony module for a welcoming ceremony and 
                congratulations from NASA and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) mission 
                officials. Afterward, safety briefings were given to the new quartet showing 
                potential lab hazards, emergency equipment locations and escape routes.

                NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover, Shannon Walker, and Japan Aerospace 
                Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Soichi Noguchi aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon 
                have arrived at the International Space Station. Crew-1 joins Expedition 64 crew 
                of Commander Sergey Ryzhikov and Flight Engineer Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, both of the
                Russian space agency Roscosmos, and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins of NASA.
                <br><br>
                The crew members first opened the hatch between the space station and the pressurized 
                mating adapter at 1:02 a.m. EST then opened the hatch to Crew Dragon.
                <br><br>
                NASA TV will continue to provide live coverage through the welcoming ceremony with 
                NASA’s Associate Administrator for Human Exploration and Operations Kathy Lueders 
                joining to greet the crew from the Mission Control Center at NASA’s Johnson Space 
                Center in Houston, and JAXA President Hiroshi Yamakawa joining from the Tsukuba 
                Space Center in Japan. The welcome ceremony is targeted to begin about 1:40 a.m.
